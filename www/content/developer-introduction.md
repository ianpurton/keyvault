Installing the precompiled binary is the easiest way to get started with Cloak. Our binaries are generated in our CI/CD pipeline and we take all the precautions we can to ensure the binary is safe to use.

## Install the precompiled binary

| System      | Download Link | SHA256 Checksum |
| ----------- | ------------- |                 |
| MacOS      | Title         |                 |
| Windows   | Text          |                 |
| Linux   | Text          |                 |

Once the zip is downloaded, unzip it into any directory. The Cloak binary inside is all that is necessary to run Cloak (or Cloak.exe for Windows). No additional files are required to run Cloak.

## Verify the checksum (Optional)

## Test the installation

```bash
Cloak -v
```
