## Features and Benefits

* End-to-End encryption - Every secret is encrypted before a single byte ever leaves your device. Only you and your team control the encryption keys and who is able decrypt your secrets.
* Eliminate secrets sprawl. When people leave or an incident happens, update secrets in one place and push it out everywhere.
* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) means users only see the secrets they need to see to do their jobs.
* Built in multi tenancy. Teams can manage their own secrets and no one person has access to all the secrets unless you give them the permission.
* Uses well known and well tested Elliptic Curve cryptography. No proprietary encryption mechanisms.
* Our web interface manages encrypted key creation and distribution to make security the default for your projects.
* The CLI tool brings secrets from the vault to you local environment, CICD pipelines, servers and more.
* Hosted by us so you don't need to manage infrastructure, upgrades or support.
* You have the option to deploy on your own servers using our docker images. Our containers are built in public from our Github CI/CD pipeline.
* Permissive MIT licence and fully open client and server source code. This not only means that you can inspect our code, but that others have done so too.
* Extensive audit trail that monitors access and usage.
